                    The usage of image processing and object identification
                    technologies such as YOLOv5 models from TensorFlow, as well
                    as a TTS engine for voice output, suggests a project based
                    on quick development and frequent testing. This is
                    compatible with Agile techniques, which require frequent
                    delivery of functioning software and allow for modifications
                    at any stage of the development process.

							The proposed solution involves the development of a versatile mobile application that integrates advanced image processing and voice communication technologies to empower blind individuals in their daily lives. This innovative app leverages image recognition to enable users to independently detect indoor object and identify market items by capturing and interpreting images, providing them with real-time audio descriptions and information. Additionally, it offers voice communication features, facilitating safe and convenient navigation, and enabling users to interact with the app through spoken commands, ensuring they can travel autonomously. Furthermore, this mobile app aims to create an inclusive and comprehensive solution that fosters greater independence and accessibility for blind individuals in diverse aspects of their daily routines
